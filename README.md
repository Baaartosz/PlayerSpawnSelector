# PlayerSpawnSelector
A friend was having problems with his game's spawning system so I implemented a class to find the spawn of his colonists.

___

### How it works
Using the number of islands algorithm which utlilises the depth first search, I locate the largest pocket and randomly generate a pre-determined amount of spawn points within that pocket.

___
### Usage
```cs
// Constructor
SpawnLocationFinder(int[,] map, int mapSize = 64, int spawnPoints = 3, int spawnSpread = 2){}
```

``map`` : 2D binary array of spawnable and non-spawnable locations.

``mapSize`` : Size of map array. Set to 64 as required by game specs.

``spawnPoints`` : Amount of spawn points required. Set to 3  as required by game specs.

``spawnSpread`` : How far apart can the spawn points be from the origin.



Getting your spawn locations works like so; There is only one public method in this class ``GenerateSpawnPoints()``;
```cs
var spawns = new SpawnSystem(map).GenerateSpawnPoints(); 
// Returns a list of spawn points either in Tuple<int,int> or Vector3 depending on version used.
```

___
### Example
Included in this example is a 32x32 test map that is fundamentally the same as the one used within the game.

```
0 = Spawnable 
1 = Non-spawnable.
```

```cs
private static int[,] testMap8x8 =
{

Using this testmap in the below gif we can see the algorithm working.
